// WHY a seam (μุน, Zone-4 free/paid gate): today /v2/calendar/[date] has NO tier logic → free users see
// all paid content (5-facet compat · per-facet readings · advanced mode · 8 gates · 8 deities). The gate
// needs a REAL flag: an unknown tier is wrong BOTH ways — guess free ⇒ a paying user loses what they paid
// for; guess paid ⇒ a free user sees everything. There is NO safe default, so the tier must be KNOWN
// before gating. Hence `isPaid: boolean | null` where **null = not determined yet — do NOT gate on it**.

// The single paid rule (matches lib/home/profile.ts deriveHomeProfile / v1 header-v2.tsx EXACTLY): a member
// is paid ONLY when the plan is still valid. Strict `=== true` (not truthy) so a stray non-boolean
// (`"true"`, `1`, `{}`) can never silently unlock paid content. #v2-tier-paid-rule
